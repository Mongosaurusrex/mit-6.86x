The probability density function (PDF) of a Gaussian distribution is given by:
$$f_X(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$
**Key Components:**

1. $\mu$ = Mean (or expectation) of the distribution:

	• Determines the center of the distribution.

2. $\sigma^2$ = Variance:

	• Describes the spread or width of the distribution.

	• $\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2}$ $is the standard deviation.

  

**Important Relationships:**

• The mean $\mu$ shifts the distribution along the x-axis.

• The variance $\sigma^2$ controls the spread:

• Larger $\sigma^2$ = wider and flatter curve.

• Smaller$ \sigma^2$ = narrower and sharper curve.

  

**Standard Normal Distribution:**

  

When $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma^2 = 1$, the Gaussian distribution becomes the standard normal distribution:
$$ f_Z(z) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{z^2}{2}}$$
where $Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}$ is the standardized variable.
