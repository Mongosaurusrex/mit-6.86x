A plane in $\mathbb{R}^3$ can be represented by the equation:
$$ax + by + cz = d$$

A plane passing through a point $\mathbf{P_0} = (x_0, y_0, z_0)$ with a normal vector $\mathbf{n} = (a, b, c)$ can be written as:
$$a(x - x_0) + b(y - y_0) + c(z - z_0) = 0$$

The **perpendicular (shortest) distance** from a point $\mathbf{P} = (x_0, y_0, z_0)$ to a plane given by the equation:
$$ax + by + cz = d$$
is calculated using the formula:
$$D = \frac{|ax_0 + by_0 + cz_0 - d|}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}$$
where:

• $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ is the given point,

• $a, b, c$ are the coefficients of the plane’s normal vector $\mathbf{n} = (a, b, c)$,

• $d$ is the constant in the plane equation.
