Given that $X$ is a continuous random variable with probability density function (pdf) $f_X(x)$:

The value of $f_X(x)$ does not always lie in the interval of $[0,1]$

For $a < b$, $\int_a^bf_X(x)dx$ represents the probability that the value of $X$ falls between $a$ and $b$

The value of $f_X(x)$ is always non negative

$\int_\infty^{-\infty}f_X(x)dx = 1$
